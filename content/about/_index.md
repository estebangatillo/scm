title: About me
---


I am an inventive and creative environmental scientist who enjoys solving complex environmental issues. For example, I made up a game called Pin-the-Beaver-in-the-Keystone to teach kids (anyone who wants to play, really...) about the imporantant role beavers, a keystone species, have on the ecology of wetlands and riparian ecosystems. It's like pin the tail on the donkey, but way cooler. Check out beaverambassadors.org to see some other things I made up!

When I'm not creating fun outreach games I do other things including spatial analytics, field surveys, presentations, design, photography and some times I host a trivia night.

#### Education

Masters of Environmental Management at Portland State.

Bachelors of Science in Environmental Science (also at Portland State)

Three years of dedicated wa/ondering at University of Oregon - a most valuable lesson in the field(s) of philosophy, art history, art, ultimate frisbee, astronomy, pizza-making, and literature.
