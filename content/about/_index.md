title: About me
---

I am here to share. I feel full in the most wonderful ways - full of life, curiosity, friends, and family. I'm so grateful for my son, my stepchildren, our dog Barley, my beautiful wife, and our old, wonderful house. All of it takes time, energy, patience, attention, presence, love and pain, and I am enthralled by all these parts to life. I am available to share it! I know some things and I'm always on the search to learn more.

In a more professional setting, I describe myself as an inventive and creative relationship scientist who enjoys solving complex issues. What is a relationship scientists? Everything is connected. How are these connections impacting one another and impacting all the things around them? For example, I made up a game called Pin-the-Beaver-in-the-Keystone to teach kids (anyone who wants to play, really...) about the important role beavers, a keystone species, have on the ecology of wetlands and riparian ecosystems. It is all connected. We are connected to the water, water is connected to the beaver, the beaver is connected to its tail, and it goes on and on, all the connections in so many incredible ways. 

When I'm not creating fun games I do other things including spatial analytics, field surveys, presentations, design, photography, go sailing, build with cob,
