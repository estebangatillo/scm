title: About me
---


I am an environmental scientist that makes things up for fun. For example, I made up a game called Pin-the-Beaver-in-the-Keystone to teach kids (anyone who wants to play, really...) about the imporantance beavers, a keystone species, have on the ecology of wetlands and riparian ecosystems! It's like pin the tail on the donkey, but way cooler. Check out beaverambassadors.org to see some other things I made up!

When I'm not making things up I do other thigs including spatial analytics, field surveys, presentations, design, photography and some times I host a trivia night.

#### Education

Masters of Environmental Management at Portland State

Three years of aimless wa/ondering at University of Oregon - a most valuable lesson in the field(s) of philosophy, art history, Art, ultimate frisbee, astronomy, pizza-making and literature.
