Students and people from West Linn have made mini beaver zines for the past three years. There are 15 unique mini beaver zines. <!--more-->

The mini beaver zines were inspired by the full size beaver zine. Dr. Ethan Seltzer led the creation of the first beaver zine. [The full size, original zine can be found here](https://wetlandsconservancy.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/The-Zine-beaversareamazing.pdf).
