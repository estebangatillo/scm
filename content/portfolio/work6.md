title: Habitat Modeling in Mt. Hood National Forest
weight: 6
---

I've been working with the Mapping Action Collective (MAC) and Bark to determine the best places to release beavers in the Mt. Hood National Forest. Beavers provide incredible ecological benefits. Due to habitat disconnectivity the ability for beavers to migrate naturally into and around Mt. Hood may be compromised. <!--more-->

We worked with Bark to find the best places to release beavers within the national forest boundary. By combining hydrology, geology and terrain characteristics we hope to locate the best beaver homes around Mt. Hood!

This is an ongoing project. Check back for more.
