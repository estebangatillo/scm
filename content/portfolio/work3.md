title: West Linn Parks & Resources Map

I made a leaflet to explore and allow others to explore natural and social resources in West Linn. The map has streams, wetlands, parks and more.


We can't always be outside in nature, but we can experience them in other ways and maybe even find places we've missed! By using geography I hope to expose the community to more resources.
