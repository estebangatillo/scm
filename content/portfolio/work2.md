Beaver Ambassadors started in West Linn, Oregon, to provide more environmental activities to our community. Beavers benefit ecosystems in countless, incredible ways. BUT they can cause conflicts with infrastructure in urban settings. Fortunately, we can (and have) found ways to work together. [Check it out here](beaverambassadors.org) to learn more about the things BA does!

Since the founding of Beaver Ambassadors we've moved on to many other environmental topics including endangered species, wolves, coyotes, salmon, water quality, forest canopy community and more. The crazy thing is...beavers directly impact all these things!

All these things also impact our lives. Beavers Ambassadors provides a space to relate to nature in positive ways. The diversity of life on our planet is a wonderful thing. [Let's go outside and have fun!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7MkHpWN-otQ)
