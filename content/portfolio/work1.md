This is a demonstration about how to use leaflet. In the demonstation, I add local analysis to leaflet to show how visual representations explain real-world issues.<!--more--> The demonstration is broken into three parts:

1. Simple demonstration about how to use leaflet
2. Creating Local Getis-Ord statistic and adding it to leaflet
3. Repeating part 2 but using Local Moran's I

If you have any questions or comments about my process please don't hesitate to reach out!
